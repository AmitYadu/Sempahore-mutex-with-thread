# Sempahore-mutex-with-thread
solve a problem using semaphores or mutuexes along with threads

There is a service counter which has a limited waiting queue outside it. It works as follows:
The counter remains open till the waiting queue is not empty
If the queue is already full, the new customer simply leaves
If the queue becomes empty, the outlet doors will be closed (service personel sleep)
Whenever a customer arrives at the closed outlet, he/she needs to wake the person at the counter with a wake-up call


Run service.cpp file using following command in terminal:
g++ service.cpp -pthread
